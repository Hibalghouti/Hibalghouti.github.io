# Prefix and Postfix Calculator

## Project Overview
The **Prefix and Postfix Calculator** is a web-based application that allows users to evaluate mathematical expressions in both **Prefix** and **Postfix** notations. These notations are commonly used in computer science and programming for efficient expression evaluation without the need for parentheses.

This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a space button for better formatting of input and the ability to toggle between light and dark modes.

### Features:
- Evaluate Prefix expressions (e.g., `+ 3 4`).
- Evaluate Postfix expressions (e.g., `3 4 +`).
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Toggle between light and dark themes.
- User-friendly interface with stack visualization for expression evaluation.
- Space button to format input expressions.
  
## Instructions for Use

1. **Enter an Expression**:
   - Use the buttons for numbers, operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and spaces to enter a valid Prefix or Postfix expression.
   - For Prefix, enter operators followed by operands (e.g., `+ 3 4`).
   - For Postfix, enter operands followed by operators (e.g., `3 4 +`).

2. **Evaluate the Expression**:
   - Click on the **Prefix** or **Postfix** button to evaluate the corresponding expression.
   - The result will be displayed below the input field.

3. **Clear Inputs**:
   - Use the **Clear** button to remove the current expression.
   - Use the **Clear Result** button to remove the result text.
   - The **Reset** button clears both the expression and result fields.

4. **Dark Mode**:
   - Toggle the theme between light and dark modes by clicking the **Dark Mode** button.

5. **Space Button**:
   - Click the **Space** button to insert spaces into the expression input for better readability.
